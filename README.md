# Agon_Light_Text_Adventures
A Collection Of Text Adventure Games Ported To The Agon Light.
Some games rely on extra files for graphics and/or sound etc,
for this reason it is advisible to keep the original folder structures for each game.

I've not fully tested all aspects of all the games so please let me know if you find any bugs.
Most games folders contain a readme.txt file, I will try and include instructions and sometimes tips within these
so they are worth a read.
