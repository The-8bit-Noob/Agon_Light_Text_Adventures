# Haunted-House
Haunted House Text Adventure Game for the Agon Light2, Originally written in 1983 for Usborne books as a type-in game listing https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Documents/Books/Write%20Your%20Own%20Adventure%20Programs%20(1983)(Usborne).pdf, I've added graphics & sound effects plus generally jazzed it up a little while porting it to the Agon Light 2.
